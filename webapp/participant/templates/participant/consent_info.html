        <li>{{ _(" <strong> What happens during the study: </strong>  This study requires you to follow one of two protocols. If you are selected to be part of the <i style='color:MediumSeaGreen;'>treatment group</i>, you will participate in COVID-19 pooled testing. Throughout the course of the study, you may receive emails inviting you to submit a saliva sample, which will be pooled with other samples and tested at the LANBAMA laboratory at IPICYT. If your test is negative, then everyone in your pool is healthy and permitted to enter the institute for 48 hours. If your test is positive, then at least one person in your pool is infected, and you (as well as all other individuals in your pool) are not permitted to enter the institute until you are selected for re-testing and the next test result is negative. At no point are you obliged to submit a saliva sample, or to enter the building. If you are selected to be part of the <i style='color:MediumSeaGreen;'>control group</i>, you will be asked to follow the same remote working policy that is currently in place at IPICYT. If you would like to access the institute, you must contact the head of your department for permission. 
            We also ask all participants to respond to a short survey at the beginning and at the end of the trial - within a month's time - where you will be asked sociodemographic questions, alongside a set of psychological questions. You are not required to answer any questions that you may find uncomfortable. Furthermore, for the purpose of COVID-19 testing, you may be asked to give a saliva sample to the technicians at LANBAMA if you are selected for pooled testing. 
            The sample will be used directly on the day of reception and will be destroyed after being processed for a qPCR test. The sample(s) will not be stored. You will be informed about the result of all pooled tests that contain your sample. ") }}</li>
        <br>
        <li>{{ _(' <strong> Participation: </strong> The trial is expected to run for a month, throughout August 2022, during which participants in the treatment group will receive free COVID-19 testing. Throughout the course of the month, the principal investigators will link health data (i.e. COVID-19 test results) to survey data (collected at the beginning and end of the trial). However, at the end of the trial all gathered data will be anonymised. If you wish to withdraw consent on the use of your data at any point during the study, please contact <a href="mailto:csef@ipicyt.edu.mx" class="link-success">csef@ipicyt.edu.mx</a>.

            You always have the option of stopping your participation in the study and you may leave at any time during the study (4 weeks from the start of the trial) without providing a reason and without penalty. If you decide to leave, the data you have provided up to this point will be anonymised immediately and deleted after attrition analysis. ') }}</li>

If you choose to participate and are selected into the treatment group, there is a risk that you will be infected if you are permitted to enter the institute and decide to do so. This risk is small, as all individuals must test negative in order to enter the institute. In particular, the C-SEF protocols are much safer than reopening without monitoring for infections. While the probability of infection can be minimised and contained, it is not guaranteed to be zero. There is always a very small chance to get infected when participating in social activities, and COVID-19 comes with small and major consequences; among which, fever, cough, loss of taste and smell, respiratory problems and, in some cases, death.
            Your survey responses are strictly confidential and will only be accessible to the researchers. Below, we describe the steps we are taking to protect your privacy.
